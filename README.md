# NodeJS + EJS Front-End + MongoDB Architecture Template

This is a Node node website prototype template, using EJS in front-end, and MongoDB as database. With the basics front + back end files prepared to jump to the constructive parte of the project.
It's a Server Side Rendering Strategy to develop web platforms.
The idea is use this repository to clone (git clone), and make faster the coding process (and use it as potfolio, as well).
Feel free to read, clone, and comment.   
Make sure NodeJS, MongoDB and Git are Installed.
